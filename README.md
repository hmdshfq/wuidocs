## Flexbox

Flexbox can be enabled by using the `d-flex` class

### Order

The flexbox children can be ordered using the `order-n` class, where `n` is the number of the order. We can also add breakpoint to enable/disable the order class by `order-breakpoint-n`.  For example, `order-md-1` will make the flexbox child element the first child above `650px`.
