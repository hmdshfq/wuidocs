## Margin and padding

### Spacing System

The spacing system for margin and padding is as following:

`m-1` where 1 is equal to `0.25rem` or `4px`\*

`m-2` where 2 is equal to `0.5rem` or `8px`

`m-3` where 3 is equal to `1rem` or `16px`

`m-4` where 4 is equal to `1.5rem` or `24px`

`m-5` where 5 is equal to `3rem` or `48px`

`m-6` where 6 is equal to `6rem` or `96px`

`m-7` where 7 is equal to `9rem` or `144px`

\*Considering 1 rem is equal to 16px

`m-1` and `p-1` means margin and padding of `0.25rem` on all four sides

`mx-1` and `px-1` means margin and padding of `0.25rem` on left and right sides

`my-1` and `py-1` means margin and padding of `0.25rem` on top and bottom sides

`mx-auto` means margin equally distributes the available space on the left and right side
